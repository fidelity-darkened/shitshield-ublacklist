Shitshield is a [uBlacklist](https://github.com/iorate/ublacklist) block list used to block SEO spam, stop further [enshittification of the internet](https://doctorow.medium.com/social-quitting-1ce85b67b456) and make searching useful and fun again.

If your website is on the list, it most likely has at least one of these issues:
* Writers use stock photos or AI-generated profile pictures to deceive the reader that the author is real or someone else
* Writers systematically publish under a fake name without declaring that a pseudonym was used
* Content is low-quality and largely generated by AI, or copied from other websites (content farms)
* Content is written to increase traffic to a website that sells a product, and that content is more or less unrelated to the product (if the promotional content is on its own subdomain or path, only that part will be blocked)
* The website isn't a blog or a hobby website but only one or a few authors created a large amount of content
* Post titles are engineered to be SEO-friendly, such as writing them as questions, including the year in the title, and starting the post with a number or "[SOLVED]" in the style of clickbait content. Examples:
  * Top 7 tips to make your iPhone faster
  * Is your laptop slow? Here's how to fix it [2024 guide]
  * [FIXED] Why won't my iPhone work properly?
* The word count is artificially inflated to include more SEO keywords, resulting in a long-winded article without much substance

There are exceptions for high-quality content. If you don't think your website should belong on the list, open an issue to explain why.

If you think the list should include a website or that a current rule is wrong, also open an issue.
