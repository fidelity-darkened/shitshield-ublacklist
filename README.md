Shitshield is a series of [uBlacklist](https://github.com/iorate/ublacklist) block lists used to block SEO spam, stop further [enshittification of the internet](https://doctorow.medium.com/social-quitting-1ce85b67b456) and make searching useful and fun again.

# Lists
Lists are mutually exclusive. If a website is on one list, it will not be on another, unless a subdomain is drastically different to the rest of the site and warrants to be included in another list.
* shitshield-seo: Blocks unuseful, SEO-crafted content designed to be hidden advertising or to profit from affiliate links
* shitshield-poor-ugc: Blocks unhelpful user-generated content like poorly moderated Q&A sites that reward users for contributing content no matter how useless it is
* shitshield-content-farm: Blocks websites filled with low-quality content lifted from another source often without permission
* shitshield-comparison: Blocks websites mass-create comparisons coupled with low-quality analysis
* shitshield-stock: Blocks stock image websites from appearing in search results. Being included in the list does not suggest the website has poor quality.

# Why is my website included?
If your website is on a list, it most likely has at least one of these issues:
* Writers use stock photos or AI-generated profile pictures to deceive the reader that the author is real or someone else
* Writers systematically publish under a fake name without declaring that a pseudonym was used
* Content is low-quality and largely generated by AI, or copied from other websites (content farms)
* Content is written to increase traffic to a website that sells a product, and that content is more or less unrelated to the product (if the promotional content is on its own subdomain or path, only that part will be blocked)
* The website isn't a blog or a hobby website but only one or a few authors created a large amount of content
* Post titles are engineered to be SEO-friendly, such as writing them as questions, including the year in the title, and starting the post with a number or "[SOLVED]" in the style of clickbait content. Examples:
  * Top 7 tips to make your iPhone faster
  * Is your laptop slow? Here's how to fix it [2024 guide]
  * [FIXED] Why won't my iPhone work properly?
* The word count is artificially inflated to include more SEO keywords, resulting in a long-winded article without much substance

There are exceptions for high-quality content. If you don't think your website should belong on the list, open an issue to explain why.

If you think the list should include a website or that a current rule is wrong, also open an issue.
